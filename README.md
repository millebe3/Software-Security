Software Vulnerability Assessment Report

The client Artemis Financial was a consulting company that developed individualized financial plans for their customers. The financial plans included savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They had a RESTful web application programming interface (API) and were seeking expertise about how to protect the organization from external threats. As part of the team, I was tasked with examining Artemis Financial's web-based software application to identify any security vulnerabilities. Thus, the Software Vulnerability Assessment Report.

I used two methods in my assessment:

Manual code review - I identified a few potential issues with the code and provided recommendations to make improvements. On this, I feel I did a fair job.
Static Testing - After adding the OWASP Maven Dependency Check to the .pom file, I was able to run a dependency check report on the client's code, review and interpret the results, and provide recommendations on making improvements. On this, I feel I did a good job.


The reason I decided to share the Secure Software Report was to show my success in solving the issues that were found when trying to run the provided base code. The perseverance I had during this project helped two of my classmates to also have success, and I'm proud of that.
